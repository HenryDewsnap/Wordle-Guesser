# Wordle-Guesser
## How It Works
>Wordle Guesser finds the frequency of the current word sets character usage.\
>Using these frequencys and data such as characters that are in the word but not in a known position,\
>characters that are definately not in the word as well as known character positions it creates a rating\
>for each word, and the higher the rating (in comparison to the other words) the more certain of a certain word the bot is.

## Usage
>Dark gray letters on the keyboard are blacklisted\
>Yellow letters on the keyboard are white listed\
>Green letters on the keyboard are known positions
